**Yet another FPGA ZX Spectrum clone ;)**

## Intro

ZX Spectrum compatible machine with a soft CPU, FDD and HDD (CF card) controllers, PS/2 keyboard/mouse, VGA output and all logic inside the Altera FPGA **EP4CE6**.

## The idea

The idea was to make a smaller Profi (Профи) ZX Spectrum clone, with real FDD and HDD controllers. The board size should fit the dimensions of the real 3.5" floppy drive. 

## Firmwares

**The main firmware is almost finished, but some features are still in progress. Currently it implements:**

1) ZX Spectrum classic and profi hi-res hi-color mode (with palette) (512x240)
2) ZX Profi CMR ports for extended peripherial
3) FDD controller that works both in CP/M and classic modes
4) HDD controller (works in Profi CP/M mode and PQ-DOS mode)
5) PS/2 keyboard (XT keyboard emulation)
6) PS/2 mouse (kempston mouse and serial MS mouse emulation)
7) VGA output (requires a monitor with 50Hz support)
8) Turbosound (2 x AY-3-8912), Soundrive and SAA1099 (SAA will work only on EP4CE10 due to lack of free LEs in EP4CE6)
9) Kempston joystick support
10) SEGA joystick support
11) RTC (profi), emulated read/write support
12) SD card access via Z-Controller emulation
13) Turbo 7 MHz
14) ZX UNO simple UART @115200 for ESP8266 module (with ability to enable a secondary ZX UNO UART on uBus connector)
15) An additional ROM bank with **PQ-DOS BIOS**
16) An additional ROM bank with **Flash Tool** by **Doctor Max** to upgrade the FGPA firmware and ROM banks without programmer
17) An additional ROM bank with **FDImage Tool** by **Doctor Max** to extract TRD, PRO and FDI images on real floppies
