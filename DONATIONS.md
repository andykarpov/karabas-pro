### ROMain, FDImage tool, FlashTool, testROM by Doctor Max

Thanks to all bakers, with your help it was possible to release a nice new tool - **FDImage by Doctor Max!**, as well as **FlashTool** and the **ROMain**.

With the FDImage tool you're able to extract FDD images (FDI, PRO, TRD, SCL, TD0) to real floppy disks.

The FlashTool is a useful thing to help users upgrade their FPGA and ROM without touching a programmer.

The ROMain is a main ROM that you see on the screen after powering on the board. There are a few tests, including a test for extended karabas palette.

Feel free to send any amount of RUB/USD/EUR/etc to support **Doctor Max** - a developer of this nice tool:
