Thanks to all bakers, with your help it was possible to release a nice new tool - **FDImage by Doctor Max!**

With this tool you're able now to extract FDD images (FDI, PRO, TRD, SCL) to real floppy disks.
The only missing feature for now is working with TeleDisk TD0 file format.

Feel free to send any amount of USD/EUR/etc to support **Doctor Max** - a developer of this nicetool:
